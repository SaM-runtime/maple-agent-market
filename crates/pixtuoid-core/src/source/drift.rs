//! Structured **decode-drift breadcrumbs** — the single source of truth for the
//! source self-diagnosis layer. Every site where the upstream wire format
//! surprises us emits ONE `tracing` event with a stable `target` + `kind` +
//! `source`, so:
//!   - the persistent warn-floor log captures it (read by `pixtuoid doctor`), and
//!   - a future counting `tracing::Layer` can tally it for the live TUI footer,
//!
//! WITHOUT any decoder signature change — the emit is an ambient side effect, so
//! the per-source `fn(&Value) -> Result<Vec<AgentEvent>>` seam (invariant #3)
//! is untouched. This is layer 2 of the upstream-drift defense ("self-monitoring
//! from the real stream") is made visible instead
//! of stranded in a log nobody reads — the gap the Task→Agent rename exposed.
//!
//! **The flood-safe axis rule (`unknown_event` has NO dedup — it warns per
//! line).** A transcript decoder's tail may breadcrumb an unrecognized shape
//! ONLY on a LOW-cardinality STRUCTURAL axis — a brand-new line SHAPE the source
//! emits a bounded number of (codex's `RolloutItem` OUTER, copilot's `type`
//! NAMESPACE, omp's entry `type`). It MUST stay SILENT on the HIGH-cardinality
//! EVENT axis — a new value under a shape we already ignore dozens of per turn
//! (codex's `EventMsg`/`ResponseItem` inners, copilot's `assistant.*_delta`,
//! omp's `customType`) — because one warn per line there floods the warn-floor.
//! Each decoder pins its axis in a `KNOWN_*` const whose COMPLETE set is verified
//! against live upstream and (where the schema is fetchable) drift-watched by
//! `check_upstream_drift.py`, so a new upstream shape is a CI review ping BEFORE
//! it can flood. This is a per-decoder DOMAIN judgment (the axis lands in a
//! different position each source — a match arm, a namespace projection, a
//! two-tier dispatch), not a shared abstraction: the guard is 3 lines, the axis
//! choice is irreducible, so the principle is codified HERE and applied inline.
//!
//! `source` is a static registry source name (safe). The free-form values
//! (`name`/`field`/`tool`/`detail`) are untrusted wire content, so they are made
//! display-safe HERE, at emission — control-stripped and capped by
//! `decoder::display_safe`. Per-consumer sanitizing was not
//! enough: a foreground CLI `tracing` stream writes to RAW stderr, which no pixel
//! buffer clips and no presenter sanitizes, and it is on by default at `warn`.
