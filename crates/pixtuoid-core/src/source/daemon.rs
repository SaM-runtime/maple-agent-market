//! The shared, daemon-AGNOSTIC presence layer. A "daemon" source (the OpenClaw
//! gateway is instance #1) produces NO agent activity — it has no desk, no
//! `AgentSlot`. Instead each running daemon INSTANCE earns one presence-gated
//! wandering mascot whose motion encodes that instance's liveness (idle ambles,
//! busy shuttles, down walks out). This module owns the state machine + lifecycle
//! that is identical for EVERY daemon; the per-daemon WIRE decode (e.g.
//! `openclaw::decode_openclaw_hook_payload`, which maps a gateway envelope →
//! [`DecodedPresence`](crate::source::daemon::DecodedPresence)) stays in the daemon's own module, exactly like an agent
//! source owns its own line/hook decoder.
//!
//! Presence rides a SIBLING channel (invariant #2: NOT the one `AgentEvent`
//! channel), carrying `PresenceMsg { key: DaemonInstanceKey, delta }` so N daemons
//! AND N instances of one daemon land in DISTINCT `SceneState::daemons` entries.
//! The reducer task merges them via
//! [`apply_presence`](crate::source::daemon::apply_presence), NEVER through
//! `Reducer::apply` (which is `AgentId`-pure). See
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-source-kind-daemon-agent-decouple-design.md`.
//!
//! **The two identity concepts are deliberately separate.** The
//! [`DaemonInstanceId`](crate::state::DaemonInstanceId) is STABLE — a gateway restarting on the same port keeps
//! its mascot — while `DaemonPresence::current_pid` is the PROCESS incarnation,
//! rebound by each `GatewayUp`. That split is what makes a late exit receipt for
//! a replaced process a no-op instead of a kill of its replacement, and it is why
//! neither the pid nor the profile name is the identity (a pid changes on every
//! restart; a profile is an install scope OpenClaw never puts on the wire).
