//! OpenClaw — the first DAEMON source (`SourceKind::Daemon`), and unlike every
//! agent source it produces NO agent activity. OpenClaw (github.com/openclaw/
//! openclaw, `docs.openclaw.ai`) is one always-on gateway daemon multiplexing
//! many chat sessions; its backend coding sessions (the bundled `claude-cli`
//! backend) are already visualized by the `cc·` source at full fidelity (a real
//! `claude` writing `~/.claude/...`).
//!
//! This module owns ONLY OpenClaw's WIRE decode (`decode_openclaw_hook_payload`),
//! INCLUDING which gateway an envelope came from — its resolved
//! `gatewayPort`, normalized to a `DaemonInstanceId`. The
//! daemon-agnostic presence STATE MACHINE + lifecycle (apply/sweep/mark, the exit
//! watch, the decay TTLs) lives in the shared [`crate::source::daemon`] layer,
//! keyed by (source, instance) so N daemons AND N gateways coexist — exactly as an
//! agent source owns its own decoder but shares the reducer.
//!
//! So each observed gateway earns a presence-gated mascot (a wandering lobster)
//! showing the one thing `cc·` can't: is that gateway alive and handling
//! traffic (its motion encodes state in its CADENCE — idle ambles on a 9s wander
//! cycle, busy shuttles on 4.5s, degraded crawls on 14s, down leaves. Destinations
//! are drawn from the whole floor and are state-INDEPENDENT: a curated per-state spot
//! list was small enough that N gateways crowded onto it, see `creatures.rs`).
//! OpenClaw officially supports several isolated gateways on one host (each with
//! its own profile/state dir and base port), so two running gateways render as two
//! independent lobsters. Its plugin (`install/openclaw_plugin.js`) forwards a
//! strict ALLOWLIST envelope — never message content (the busy tell needs only the
//! run pairing key) — stamped `_pixtuoid_source: "openclaw"` by the shim:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"type":"gateway_start","gatewayPort":18789,"_pid":12345}
//! {"type":"session_start","gatewayPort":18789,"sessionId":"…","sessionKey":"agent:main:…"}
//! {"type":"before_agent_run","gatewayPort":18789,"runId":"…","sessionId":"…"}
//! {"type":"agent_end","gatewayPort":18789,"runId":"…","sessionId":"…"}
//! {"type":"session_end","gatewayPort":18789,"sessionId":"…","reason":"idle","messageCount":4}
//! {"type":"gateway_stop","gatewayPort":18789,"reason":"shutdown"}
//! ```
//!
//! This decoder is PURE — `Value → DecodedPresence` (the sending gateway's
//! identity plus its deltas). The updates ride an INSTANCE-tagged SIBLING channel
//! (NOT the one `AgentEvent` channel — invariant #2), merged into
//! `SceneState::daemons` by the reducer task via `daemon::apply_presence`, NEVER
//! through `Reducer::apply` (which is `AgentId`-pure). See the design specs
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-openclaw-lobster-hq-design.md` +
//! `2026-06-15-source-kind-daemon-agent-decouple-design.md`.
//!
//! Capture-grounded facts (§2 of the spec): tools are invisible under the
//! `claude-cli` backend (no `before_tool_call`), `before_agent_run`/`agent_end`
//! require `allowConversationAccess`, `session_end` fires on clean close but not
//! on SIGTERM. Busy is therefore a self-healing decay, never a latch — per RUN,
//! on that run's own last observation (the daemon-wide `last_seen` is refreshed by
//! any event, so keying the decay on it latched Busy on a gateway that kept
//! serving other traffic).
