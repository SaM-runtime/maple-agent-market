//! Ambient wandering creatures — the office pet and the OpenClaw gateway mascot —
//! and WHERE they roam each frame. This is sim/behaviour: `pixel_painter` consumes
//! the positions produced here and paints them (the "scene decides, painter draws"
//! contract). The pet and the gateway mascot share ONE roaming rule — draw a
//! destination from the whole walkable floor (`walkable_target`), walk there with the
//! no-flash `walk_between`, rest — so there is nothing left for them to drift on;
//! kept together until a second pet/mascot makes a per-entity split pay for itself
//! (moved wholesale out of `pixel_painter/drawable.rs`).
//!
//! That rule REPLACED a curated per-furniture visit-spot list, and the trade is the
//! point: the list was small enough (3-25 points, and structurally 5 for idle at any
//! office size) that N creatures shared destinations by pigeonhole, so every fix for
//! the crowding had to be bolted on — per-state spot sets, a seeded standing-offset
//! ring with boxed-in and crowded fallbacks, an elevator hold that then needed its own
//! offset. Drawing from ~9k cells instead deleted that whole family (~370 lines of
//! code and tests) and halved the measured crowding. What was GIVEN UP: destinations
//! no longer encode daemon state, and a creature may rest in open floor rather than
//! beside furniture. State still reads from the CADENCE (`MASCOT_*_CYCLE_MS`: busy
//! shuttles on a 4.5s cycle, idle ambles on 9s, degraded crawls on 14s) and the
//! sprite tint.
