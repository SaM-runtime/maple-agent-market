//! Process-level contracts of the REAL `pixtuoid` binary — anything that only
//! holds once clap, config resolution, and the runtime are wired together, which
//! no in-process test can reach.
//!
//! SCOPE NOTE: this file began as the `sources --json` golden alone and was
//! widened deliberately. The second contract here is the CONNECTION GATE, which
//! is process-level by nature: it is the composition of `resolve_connected`
//! (config) with `reducer_task`'s per-event drop (runtime). Each half is
//! individually correct and the composition still silently ate every Codex
//! event, which no in-process test could observe. Keep new tests to that bar —
//! a contract that genuinely needs the real process — rather than letting this
//! become a general binary-test dumping ground.
//!
//! 1. `sources --json` — the stable shape external automation parses. Exercises clap
//!    parse → `sources::status` → the JSON presenter → stdout, which the
//!    in-process `source_status_*` unit tests (struct shape + committed schema)
//!    never cover.
//! 2. The connection gate end-to-end — a real rollout dripped into a real
//!    `run --headless` appears as a sprite iff its source is connected.
//!
//! Determinism: the golden is a function of the REGISTRY, not of what's installed
//! on the test machine — SO LONG AS the environment is fully isolated. Every row is
//! `connected: false`, because an empty HOME has no config file and a source is
//! connected only on an explicit `[sources]` `true` (the v0.4–0.7 "absent flag ⇒
//! connected iff hooks installed" migrate inference was dropped in 0.12.0). So
//! `cli_present` is the only field that varies, and it splits on registry shape:
//! a target-bearing source probes absent in the empty HOME → `false`, while a
//! no-target one has no target to probe → `true`. We clear the
//! env and point HOME at an empty tempdir so every presence/hook probe sees nothing
//! (see the e2e-isolate-home lesson). Unix-only: the Windows home-var isolation
//! differs and can't be verified from here; the wire SHAPE is pinned cross-platform
//! by `source_status_json_shape_is_stable` and this end-to-end golden.
