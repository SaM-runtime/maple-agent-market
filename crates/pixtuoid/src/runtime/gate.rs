    // The connection gate on HOOK transport, end to end (#735). The gate + the
    // 1-Hz reconciler are two layers of ONE contract — a disconnected source
    // renders no PERSISTENT sprite. This drives a REAL decoded hook payload
    // through the SAME `apply_gated_event`/`reconcile_sweep_tick` functions
    // `reducer_task` runs (NOT a re-implementation — the #741/#751 fix), both
    // ways.
    //
    // The two layers matter separately because they cover different events in one
    // payload. A hook `preToolUse` decodes to `[Identity{source}, ActivityStart]`
    // (#221): the per-event gate drops the source-carrying `Identity`, but the
    // bare `ActivityStart` that follows resolves to `None` in `event_source` (its
    // id has no slot yet), slips the gate once, and synthesizes a BLANK-source
    // slot. The reconciler is the documented safety net that sweeps that blank
    // slot (its `""` source is not in the connected set). The residual is bounded
    // but NOT instant: the reconcile MARKS the slot exiting (`cascade_exit`), then
    // it walks out over `EXIT_GRACE_WINDOW` (9.5s) before `sweep_exited` removes
    // it — a few-second blank `#N`, not a one-tick disappearance. Bounded to at
    // most ONE such slot per session id AT A TIME: a later event for the same id
    // coalesces onto that one slot (AgentId identity) rather than adding another.
    // Still not worth a third gating layer: an AgentId-keyed "gated ids" map with
    // its own TTL/GC, to shave a self-correcting cosmetic that rides out alongside
    // the source's real walk-out, is the defensive-arm smell the review taxonomy
    // warns against.
    //
    // `drive_hook_gate` returns (slots BEFORE the reconcile, live slots AFTER) so
    // each layer gets independent teeth: a source-carrying event (SessionStart/
    // Identity) is dropped by the GATE — 0 before reconcile — while a bare
    // activity event only clears at the RECONCILE. A single "after" count would
