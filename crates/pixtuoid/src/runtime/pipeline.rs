//! The source → reducer pipeline used by the floating window.
//!
//! This module owns the shared source-set, reducer and presence-channel wiring.
//! Window-specific values remain caller-side:
//! - **`boot_caps`**: floating measures its window pixels, so the pipeline takes
//!   the seed as a parameter and never computes presentation geometry.
//! - **socket resolution + `ConnectedSources`**: both values outlive the
//!   boot, so the caller owns them and hands in a clone.
//!
//! Requires an ambient tokio runtime context; floating holds an `rt.enter()`
//! guard so the `tokio::spawn`s land on its runtime.
//!
//! Like its two callers this is codecov-excluded async glue (#103): the win
//! is ONE authority for the wiring, not new test surface — behavior stays
//! pinned through the reducer/watcher/transport suites that drive the
//! spawned halves.
