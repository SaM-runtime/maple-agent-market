//! `pixtuoid floating` — the frameless, always-on-top desktop window that renders the
//! live office (every agent across every connected CLI) without opening the TUI.
//!
//! A binary-only front-end on the shared engine: it boots the SAME
//! `runtime::pipeline::spawn_pipeline` spine the TUI uses (source → reducer →
//! SceneState; #714), but presents each frame as a full-resolution
//! [`offscreen::OfficeRenderer`] `RgbBuffer` blitted into a `winit` +
//! `softbuffer` window instead of half-block terminal cells. `pixtuoid-core` stays
//! window-free (invariant #1) — all windowing lives here.
