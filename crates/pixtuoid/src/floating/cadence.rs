//! The floating window's PAINT CADENCE — pure, so the animation throttle is
//! unit-testable (and coverage-counted) while `window.rs` stays codecov-ignored
//! winit glue, the same split as `geometry.rs` and `input.rs`.
//!
//! The subtlety this module exists for: `ApplicationHandler::about_to_wait` runs
//! on EVERY event-loop iteration, so an unconditional `Window::request_redraw()`
//! there leaves a redraw pending whenever the loop reaches its wait — the
//! `ControlFlow::WaitUntil` deadline set beside it then never sleeps, and the
//! window renders + presents back-to-back at 100% of a CPU core in every scene
//! state. Gating the redraw REQUEST on a deadline (not just arming the wait) is
//! what makes the FPS constants below take effect.
