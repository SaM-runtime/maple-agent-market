//
// Forwards OpenClaw gateway daemon-presence signals to pixtuoid's `pixtuoid-hook`
// shim, which relays them to the running Maple Agent Market window
// gateway mascot).
//
// PRIVACY (load-bearing): build the shim payload from an explicit ALLOWLIST of
// timing/id fields ONLY — NEVER message content, prompts, or file paths. The
// `allowConversationAccess` grant only un-gates `before_agent_run`/`agent_end`
// firing; it does NOT sanitize the payload — this allowlist is the sanitizer.
//
// NEVER BLOCK THE GATEWAY (pixtuoid invariant #5). `before_agent_run` is an
// AWAITED, FAIL-CLOSED decision gate on the user's own turn (upstream registers
// it `fail-closed`, and a throw or a >15s hang discards their prompt), so three
// rules hold here:
//   1. the shim is spawned DETACHED + unref'd and NOTHING is awaited;
//   2. every handler is try/catch'd and can never throw;
//   3. the decision hook returns an EXPLICIT `{ outcome: "pass" }`.
// Rule 3 is deliberate. `undefined` also passes today (upstream filters it out
// before its merge policy runs, and `void` is in the declared handler type), but
// that merge policy still CONTAINS a written `undefined → block` arm which only
// the filter keeps unreachable. An explicit pass is the shape the contract is
// designed around — "only pass and block outcomes are supported" — so it cannot
// be inverted by that one guard changing. Any EXTRA key is rejected as a
// malformed decision and fails closed: keep this object exactly one key.
//
// GATEWAY IDENTITY (`gatewayPort`): OpenClaw supports several isolated gateways
// per host, each on its own base port, so the port is the runtime identity
// pixtuoid keys a mascot on. `gateway_start` hands us the REAL bound port
// (`event.port`, mirrored on the gateway hook ctx) and that is the only
// authoritative source — a `--port` override stays a local inside OpenClaw's
// gateway CLI and reaches NEITHER `api.config.gateway.port` NOR
// `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`. So the port is adopted from any hook that carries one
// and remembered; the registration-time resolution below (upstream's own
// env → config → default order) is only the fallback for a plugin hot reload,
// which re-runs `register` WITHOUT replaying `gateway_start`. Accepted residual,
// and note the DIRECTION: after a plugins-only hot reload of a `--port`-overridden
// gateway, the re-registered module falls back to the config/default port, so from
// then on every forwarded event carries the WRONG port. It is the real-port mascot
// that goes silent and gets TTL-swept, while the wrong-port one is refreshed for the
// gateway's whole life — i.e. the hover permanently misidentifies which gateway it
// is, not a transient second lobster. Whether a fix is even possible depends on
// something not measured here: whether OpenClaw re-imports the module cache-busted
// on reload (a fresh module cannot remember a learned port; a reused one could).
//
// Deliberately NO `import { resolveGatewayPort } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/core"`:
// this file is dropped into OpenClaw's state dir, whose path chain contains no
// `node_modules/openclaw` for a globally installed CLI, so a bare-specifier
// import would fail module resolution and take the WHOLE plugin down (no
// lobster). The resolution order is mirrored instead — see DEFAULT_GATEWAY_PORT.
