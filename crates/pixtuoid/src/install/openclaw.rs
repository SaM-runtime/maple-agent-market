//! OpenClaw install target — the TWO-OWNERSHIP hybrid.
//!
//! OpenClaw is one always-on gateway DAEMON; pixtuoid renders it as a single
//! presence-gated wandering lobster mascot. Its plugin observes the gateway
//! lifecycle and pipes a STRICT allowlist of timing/id fields (never message
//! content) to the `pixtuoid-hook` shim (`--source openclaw`).
//!
//! Unlike opencode (a single auto-discovered plugin file), OpenClaw needs BOTH:
//!   1. the plugin DIR — `<openclaw-home>/plugins/pixtuoid/{openclaw.plugin.json,
//!      package.json, index.js}` — wholly owned by pixtuoid (the `extra_artifacts`
//!      Target hook writes these verbatim, the shim path baked into `index.js`).
//!   2. a config merge into `<openclaw-home>/openclaw.json` adding
//!      `plugins.load.paths += [<plugin-dir>]` and `plugins.entries.pixtuoid =
//!      { enabled: true, hooks: { allowConversationAccess: true } }`.
//!
//! Capture-confirmed: `openclaw plugins install --link <dir>` +
//! `enable` writes EXACTLY those config keys to openclaw.json (no separate
//! registry), so the install is a pure `ConfigLock` write — no subprocess. The
//! `allowConversationAccess` grant un-gates `before_agent_run`/`agent_end` (the
//! busy tell); UNINSTALL REVOKES it (removes our `entries.pixtuoid` subtree) so a
//! disconnect leaves no standing conversation-access grant. The plugin files are
//! left in place on uninstall (the config un-merge stops the gateway loading
//! them) — an accepted residual like opencode's stub.
